# General description

This repository contains scripts used to parse the *hp.obo*
and *phenotype_annotation.tab*
files from [HPO](https://hpo.jax.org/) and organize
the data according to a customized data model.

(available on [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/package=ReDaMoR)).
It is available in the **model** folder.

The **Collections** subfolder contains json files which formally describe
tables gathering information about key concepts, such as genes or diseases,
that can be used create cross-reference with other resources.

([Dictionary of Disease Ontologies](https://github.com/Elysheba/DODO)).
